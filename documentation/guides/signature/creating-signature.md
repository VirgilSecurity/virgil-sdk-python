# Creating Signature

This guide is a short tutorial on how to create a **Digital Signature** with Virgil Security. A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender, that the sender cannot deny having sent the message, and that the message was not altered in transit. It can be used with any kind of message – whether it is encrypted or not.

See our [Use Cases](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-sdk-python/tree/docs-review/documentation) to find out what you can do with Digital Signature.

Set up your project environment before starting to create a Digital Signature, with the [getting started](/documentation/guides/configuration/client-configuration.md) guide.

The **Signature Creation** procedure is shown in the figure below.

In order to create a Digital Signature and sign the message, Alice has to have her **Virgil Key**.


Let's review the **Digital Signature** creation process:

- Developers need to initialize the **Virgil SDK**

```python
virgil = Virgil("[YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE]")
```

- Load Alice's Virgil Key from the protected storage and enter the Virgil Key's password;

```python
# load Virgil Key
alice_key = virgil.keys.load("[KEY_NAME]", "[KEY _PASSWORD]")
```

To load the Virgil Key from a specific storage, developers need to change the storage path during Virgil SDK initialization.

Then Alice has to:
- Prepare the information for the message to Bob
- Sign the message using her Virgil Key

```python
# prepare a message
message = "Hey Bob, hope you are doing well."

# wrap data to buffer
data_buff = VirgilBuffer.from_string(message)

# generate signature
signature = alice_key.sign(data_buff)
```

See our guide on [Loading Keys](/documentation/guides/virgil-key/loading-key.md) for more examples.

Now Alice can send a signed message to Bob.
